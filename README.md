# Challenge-2_Advanced_CSS_Professional_Portfolio
The Repository for challenge 2 of the UNB Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp.

## Description
I was motivated to create this application so that I have a responsive and visually appealing portfolio that I can show to potential employers. Although I do not have many projects under my belt yet, I wanted to be proactive in creating a foundational hub that I can expand upon later as my body of work grows. This page will help me with networking by allowing anyone who may be so inclined to view my portfolio of work, and concomitantly solves the problem of employers not knowing what I am capable of by serving as a reference for them as to my experience/skills as a developer. Overall, the most challenging aspect of creating this application was making the images in the body section responsive. I struggled for a long time to figure out how to make it work and I am still not sure that I am fully pleased with the final outcome. I had initially imagined solving the problem of showing my images using media queries, but I could not get that to work. Then I tried using grid display but then could not include a link in my image, make it more opaque on hover, or add the label overtop. I was eventually able to find a helpful resource on w3schools that helped me learn more about the flex property and how I can start using that in my applications. I think that it did a serviceable job making the main content section relatively responsive, although there is some to be desired. I hope that as my skill as a developer grows I can make more responsive applications! While working on this project I also had the opportunity to learn more about many topics including grid layout, figure captions, flexbox, and media queries. I also learned a lot more about how CSS selectors work and became more comfortable using them. One final nifty thing that I learned was how to insert symbols into HTML using fa-icons. As I develop as a creator, I plan to add additional sections.

## Installation
No installation is required to access this portfolio, all that is required is a modern search engine and the URL. 

## Usage
This portfolio should be accessible on all modern search engines. Further, as this page is designed to be responsive, it should be farily easy to navigate whether you are on a laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. If you do have have any difficulties accessing the file, however, please feel free to reach out to me at jaredryan1997@hotmail.com and I would be happy to attempt to assist. Eventually, I hope that all the pictures in the my portfolio will link to the location where their respective application is deployed. However, as I am still a novice developer, all but the study guide is a placeholder with no associated application. Instead, I have linked to applications by other people that are somewhat similar to the applications I hope to eventually be able to design.
